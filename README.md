# Exercise-helper

This is an exercise helper based on [Testalo](https://github.com/Usioumeo/Testalo)
It contains the exercises for the first three sheets of exercises, and more will be added.
This is an useful resource, because it already checks if your exercise is correct or not with "blind" tests.

Feel free to add new exercises. For the syntax you could check the subfolder exercises/src/sheet*/*.

## How to run
You could clone this repository and execute it with "cargo run", or download the precompiled executable from releases (NB: on Apple we got some reports that the precompiled binary does not work, any help in order to fix it is accepted).
